# week 2

## summary

- worked with gaussain filter (tried applying filter on color image, salt and pepper image)
- worked with median filter (tried applying filter on colored salt and pepper image)
- tried to find weiner filter, bilinear filter, failed
- set research topic: best filter in PET, CT, MRI (brain scanning)
- searched for brain scanning images on MedPix(National Library of Medicine)
  - were lots of CT and MRI, but lack of PET

## questions and discussions

- what is needed to get satisfying results in colored images?
- why are the edges of the image get black (in gaussian) or the noise is not removed (in median)?
- what kinds of image filters are mostly needed in PET, CT, MRI?
- I keep encounter lack of source codes of image filters that are written in JAVA
